### Version
1.0.0

### Bugs

Plenty of these at present moment:

*Still working on getting the favorites list to work, currently crashes when moving to the new activity.
*Certain images are too big and crash the app.  Resizing would be required, for instance, to see the Port Authority gloryhole description.
*There's an old saying, "If you write an app, you gotta crash it."
